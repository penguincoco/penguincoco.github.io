_A soothing walking sim with environment puzzles._

Welcome to the Cloud Forest, a calming digital greenhouse in which the player walks around, picks up power sources in the form of lotuses, and places them on pedestals to dynamically change the environment around them.

## My role on the project
I was the primary 3D artist and general visual director on the project. All 3D models were made by me and I made all decisions on what the environment objects should be and the colour palette.
