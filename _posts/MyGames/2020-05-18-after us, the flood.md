_A narrative game with rhythm mechanics._


As part of the Game Design BFA, all graduating seniors are required to complete a senior capstone project. I joined the team of _after us, the flood_ halfway through the project. 

Although I was originally onboarded as a VFX artist, I ended up working heavily as a programmer as well. 

My main contributions to the project were implementing non-animated visual feedback, basic audio passing (excluding the music) and the current implementation of the rhythm game.
