_A narrative game with rhythm mechanics._


As part of the Game Design BFA, all graduating seniors are required to complete a senior capstone project. I joined the team of _after us, the flood_ halfway through the project. 

_after us, the flood_ is a narrative game with rhythm mechanics that explores themes of stagnation. 

You wake up as Piper, an amnesiac with a knack for music. Together with the overly friendly Fidel, a resident of the strange yet nostalgic town you've found yourself in, romp around in a dilapidated mall and learn more about a place, and people, who've chosen to be frozen in time.

## My role on the project
Although I was originally onboarded as a VFX artist, I ended up working heavily as a programmer as well. 

My main contributions to the project were implementing non-animated visual feedback, basic audio passing (excluding the music) and the current implementation of the rhythm game.
