_GIRLS._ 


What’s the best way I could start International Women’s Day? 

Ah, yes, a 10K run.

That’s exactly how I started my International Women’s Day 2019.

When I was in middle school and in my early years of high school, I did a lot of sports such as Tae Kwon Do, swimming, gymnastics. I enjoyed many of them but I ultimately quit each one because I always thought I wasn’t good enough. By my senior year in high school, I as quite out of shape and quite unhappy with my physical state, so I started running regularly. The beginning was a little discouraging; running’s a high intensity sport that requires a lot of mental fortitude as well (most of my friends say they hate running because it’s boring, which I can understand). Also a lot of people told me that I was too short to be a runner and didn’t have the endurance for it. Honestly, I believed both of those things to be true at first, but since it was proving successful in terms of weight loss and there was a treadmill in my house so I didn’t have to face the outside world while running, I didn’t quit. To my own surprise, I eventually grew to love the sport and now, now I can’t imagine my life without it. When I run, I feel free--call me crazy or call it hysteria, but I’ve cried on runs before; it’s become a way for me to release emotion and reduce stress. When I run, I feel powerful--there’s special kind of empowerment that I experience when my heel hits the ground, when that exhale slips through my lips, when that drop of sweat slides down the back of my neck. If someone were to ask me to recall a time that I felt unstoppable, I would tell the story about when I completed my first-ever half marathon.

A few weeks ago, I saw Serena Williams’ “Dream Crazier” ad from Nike. In it, Williams narrates, “a woman running a marathon was crazy”. In the past year, I’ve participated in several 5Ks, 10Ks and two half marathons and truthfully, I never once thought about how I was able to do those things. After the ad, I looked up who the first woman to ever run a marathon was. I spent nearly an hour reading into about how in 1967, Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to ever register for the Boston Marathon. But her ability to participate wasn’t due to the rules openly stating that women are allowed to join, it was because the name she registered under was gender neutral so officials likely couldn’t tell #261 was, in fact, a woman. I saw the pictures about how Jock Semple, a race official, jumped off of a moving vehicle to try and push her off of the course. I heard Switzer recount how she was terrified in that moment but not long after, her fear and humiliation turned to anger, because she knew if she quit, “Jock Semple and all those like him would win.” And despite all of this, women still weren’t allowed to officially join the race until 1972. Although I didn’t know any of this beforehand, it didn’t surprise me that women had to fight so hard for something as small as participating in a race. 

So today, I’m incredibly thankful that other than registration limit, there’s nothing at all that prevents me from running the Boston Half Marathon, or any other races. And running the Boston Half Marathon last fall was empowering not only because of the joy of being able to complete 13.1 miles, but also because of the camaraderie I witnessed between the female runners. 

At about mile 4, the course makes a u-turn meaning that miles 3 and 5 run parallel to each other on the same road, just in opposite directions. Although I love running and I’ve improved a lot since I started 4 years ago, I’m still nowhere near the fastest. When I reached mile 3 and started seeing the runners that were at the very front of the race, not only was it so intimidating to see people that had been able to cover nearly twice as much distance in the same amount of time as I had, but they were also mostly men. That kind of sucked. I can’t exactly recall, but I counted 7 or 8 men at the head of the race. At last, I spotted a woman. Seeing her keeping up with all of the men was nothing short of encouraging and inspiring. The other women running around me, all of us still just passing 5K, started cheering her on.

“You go girl!” 

“Badass!” 

One woman screamed, “who run the world!?” And the woman near the front replied, “girls!”, made a hang loose sign with her hand and suddenly summoned the strength to pass the two men right in front of her. I didn’t get to see the looks on their faces, but I imagine it would’ve been something of shock and determination to try and retake their spots in front of her, but I don’t think they did. 

It was truly beautiful seeing women supporting other women. There was no bitterness or jealousy resulting from being so far behind. And actually, when it got my turn to be around mile 5 and seeing those making their ways towards the u-turn, a lot of women were also cheering on those behind us. 

“You can do it!” 

“You’ve come too far to quit!”

I even saw a woman wearing a shirt that said, “we’re proving them all wrong just by being here.” Not “I’m”, “we’re”. It’s not a competition, it’s not a comparison. It’s all women together. Supporting each other. Proving that we can do anything. We were all channeling a little bit of Kathrine Switzer and showing that as long as she has enough determination, a woman can run any distance--5k, 10k, full marathon, half marathon. Maybe in the literal sense, the Boston Half Marathon is a competition, and all of the female racers that led the pack might have been competing for the gold medal, but solidarity coming from women who weren’t the fastest, weren’t the strongest, was something I’ve never witnessed amongst men. 

Women get called nasty. Women get called crazy. But you know what? If they equate to a community of encouragement, well, then I have to admit, I don’t much mind being called a nasty, crazy woman.  

So, to all of my female friends out there, Happy International Women’s Day. We’re all strong and we’re all capable of anything, and don’t ever let anyone tell you or another woman otherwise.
