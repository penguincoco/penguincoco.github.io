_A short story about a meatball shaped like Dick Cheney._


**Tokyo, Japan.**
**18:24 JST.**

“Tadaima.” 

_Not like anyone’s home to welcome me._ The bitter thought ran through her head.

No comfort of “okaeri”. 

Or, that was a lie--her dog came scampering up to her, but it’s not as if Mo can speak anyway, so it didn’t make much of a difference. 

Using her left foot, she eased her right shoe off, then repeated the process on the other side. If her mom were there she’d probably have an aneurysm, “don’t take your shoes off like that, you’ll ruin the heels!” She’s always cautious to take her shoes off with her hands whenever her mom’s around, but she was alone, so she could do whatever she wanted. 

Alone. 

Just her and Mo. 

Mo and her. 

She’s always been that kind of person that likes her alone time, but not too much, if that makes sense. Some days she’ll get irritated when someone tries to talk to her but then on others she’ll be like a child star that wants back into the spotlight and desperately look for people to talk to. Today, she was feeling the latter mode, but didn’t want to say it.

She picked her shoes up and put them neatly onto the rack next to a pair of Oxfords. They hadn’t been worn for nearly a year and were collecting dust, but she refused to put them into storage. It made her feel as though he were still there. God, she wished he was there. He always knew which mood she was in, chatterbug or hermit. She never had to explain to him. 

She plucked her headphones out of her ears and placed her phone facedown on the counter that divided the kitchen from the living room and stared into the open space. Mo, who had made himself comfortable on the carpet in front of the TV, looked up at her, head cocked sideways. Past him stood a sliding door to a balcony that overlooked all of Tokyo. 

_The sun must be going down soon._

The faded pink sky was rapidly transitioning into a deep purple and she could see the boats in the Bay starting to light up one by one. In the morning, light from the rising sun came straight into the living room and kitchen, blinding any poor soul that happened to look out the window, but in the evening, the natural light in the apartment always suggested that it was later than it really was. Maybe that’s why it felt so chilly. It was mid May, the apartment should have felt warmer. She told herself it was probably because the the cold, blue light flooded in from the window. That and all of the empty space. The whole place used to feel like a shoebox, but now it felt like an open range. Guess that’s what happens when there isn’t a 190 centimeter giant walking around the place.

_Open range? Giant? Huh, imagine that, what if there was a giant that was a farmer. A real giant, not giant in the sense of a tall human, giant as in “head grazes the bottom of the clouds” type, and they raise sheep or cows or whatever, but not giant ones. The animals are the size of regular animals. How would that work? They’d step on their livestock all the time… They have super enhanced vision? Or an extra sense that allows them to know…? Is this stupid or too weird? Well, I mean, obviously it’s weird, you’re talking about a giant raising sheep…_ 

She wasn’t sure how long she had spaced out for, but her stomach crying, begging to be fed, dragged her back to reality. Her mind drifted to her uneaten teriyaki salmon bento box from lunch. 

_I should finish that, shouldn’t I._

But as soon as she opened her lunch bag to reveal the delicious bento box, her stomach clenched and her appetite disappeared. It’s not that she didn’t want to eat. She thought back to all the times they’d competed at all-you-can-eat sushi and nearly eaten themselves into comas. 
Nope, definitely not the lack of desire to eat. 


_Maybe I should go for a walk. That helps my appetite sometimes. Mo looks like he could use a walk too… And if I start to feel hungry we can go to that little Udon shop by the river._

_Or maybe I’ll just go to bed. But it’s not even 7PM yet, that’s too crazy… That’s probably unhealthy, killing hunger by going to bed…_

_Or should I just try and stomach some food and hope that it doesn’t come up…? Ugh but what if I do throw up? I mean it happens frequently enough but doesn’t mean I enjoy it._

Her intense debate with herself was rudely interrupted by the phone’s incessant buzzing. 

She groaned. 

_Is it even worth it to look?_

She’d likely be ignoring it anyway. Shouldn’t her friends know that she hates phone calls? Her eyebrows furrowed and she heaved a monstrous exhale as she flipped the phone over to look at the caller ID. Surprised that it wasn’t spam, her expression softened as soon as she saw the name on the screen. 

“Hello?” any trace of annoyance she had just seconds before dissipated.

“I dropped my meatball on the floor!” The voice on the other end said. 

“What?” she replied, her eyebrows furrowing again, but not out of irritation, this time out of complete confusion.

“I dropped my meatball on the floor!” The voice repeated again in the same impassioned voice with little to no concern about how bewildering the statement was. 

“You called to tell me that you dropped a meatball… On the floor.” Her eyes shifted back and forth, lips pulled into the shape of a small “o”, trying to understand what was going on. It wasn’t unlike him to call her dramatically about something so silly, but still, she was lost. 

“Well, yeah.” He said, as if it was obvious.

She drew and quick breath and opened her mouth as if to say something but immediately closed it again. A few moments of silence passed until she started to feel the smile creep into her lips and she broke out into a giggle. “What… Just, what? You called me all the way from London just to tell me that you dropped a meatball on the floor.” 

“No no no but okay seriously, hold on, I’ll text you a picture, you’ve got to see this meatball.” 

“Honey, I don’t want to see the mea-” Her sentence cut off by her phone buzzing at the receival of a new message. Despite saying that she didn’t want to see it, her curiosity got the better of her. 

Her mouth dropped. 

“Oh my god! It looks like Dick Cheney!” 

“I _KNOW_ RIGHT?” He beamed. 

“You know you could get famous from this, right? Remember that guy in Florida who had a Jesus-shaped water stain on the side of his house a few years back? He was all over the news for like, two days! You can get famous for this Dick Cheney meatball!” 

“I uh, I don’t think anyone wants to be famous for that.” 

“Hmmm, soune--fair enough.” She could tell he was smiling on the other end of the line, and he must have known that she was on her side. Neither of them said anything for a few moments. Nothing the sound of breathing gently disturbing the quiet. It was completely dark outside now, lights in windows speckling the view from the kitchen. She hadn’t bothered to turn the lights on, the cold light from outside still dominating her apartment, but she was starting to feel warmer.   

“So… Wait,” she eventually continued, “isn’t it like, 9:30AM where you are? What are you doing eating a meatball at 9:30 in the morning?” 

“Hey! I’ve been up since 3AM rendering a slice of pie, okay!? I’m hungry and the only thing I had in my fridge was some leftover pasta and meatballs. You know better than anyone that we don’t follow the conventional rules of meal eating in this industry, Miss Burrito-at-4:37 AM.” He responded with a little huff at the end. 

“That was one time!” 

“And this is my first time eating a meatball at 9------37 am!” 

“Okay okay, I know I know, I was just giving you a hard time.”

“I know. I’m just repaying the favour.” He retorted. She could hear the grin in his voice.  

She sighed. “I miss you.” 

“I miss you too. Just a few more months until my project here in London ends, then I’ll be coming home.” 

“Just a few more months without my best friend.” 

“Don’t let Mo hear you say that.” 

She smiled and did one of those half laughs that’s basically just exhaling through your nose with a high-pitched grunt, but her eyes remained weighed down with sadness. 

“I’m sorry…” He said softly, “I have to, I have to get to work.” 

Taking a deep breath, “I know,” her voice fragile, “I love you.”

“I love you too.”

They both counted to three in their heads and hung up simultaneously--in all their years together, they’d never done the classic “no you hang up!”, they never really cared about who hung up first, but they’d still somehow established a routine to get around having to decide who would carry the burden of pressing the little red button. She couldn’t remember how they came up with it. Maybe it was before they got married? Neither of them knew, but it’s what they’d always done. 

She attached a leash to Mo’s collar, put on her sneakers and went out into the night. 

He ate his remaining meatball, brushed his teeth and set out for the day. 

Time zones are always hard. Her work day ends just as his starts. But they always found a way to make it work. This wasn’t the first time one had called the other to tell them something stupid. One time it was because of a squirrel carrying a piece of bread the size of a golf ball. Another it was because of a pigeon that had accidentally meandered its way onto the Tube and was narcissistically enjoying all of the attention. Today it was thanks to a meatball shaped like Dick Cheney. 

_Huh, who knew Dick Cheney could do something good._
