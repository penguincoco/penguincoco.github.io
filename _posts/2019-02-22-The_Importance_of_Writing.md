_How I became a writer._  


“So, what’s on the menu for next week?” Immediately after finishing my piece about The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I got to work thinking about what I’d write next. I had so many ideas that I started to get jittery and needed to take a walk. All the while, I found it hilarious that I was so excited to write something that I literally had calm myself down. Just 5 years ago, I hated writing. I would march around my house dramatically proclaiming my fiery hatred for it and full intention to never write anything again once I reached college. That didn’t work out too well for me--NYU’s core curriculum requires all students to take a freshman writing seminar. But I guess I should thank NYU, because I came to realise that I never hated writing, I just hated high school essays; I hated reading a book I didn’t care about and answering a prompt that I had no opinion on. In reality, writing isn’t just something that I love, it’s something that I need. 

When I got to NYU, I dreaded the infamous Writing the Essay class requirement. To my surprise, there were no required books, no required prompts. I was basically told to pick a writer, find an argument, and turn it in on time. The freedom to choose was unbelievable and increased my passion for my arguments which, in turn, made my essays stronger. But, I still lacked a lot of confidence in my ability as a writer, so I often asked my roommate for help editing major assignments. The first few times were a little discouraging; I’d give her what I thought was my final draft and it would come back riddled with suggestions. I continued calling myself a bad writer through the first half of that semester until one day, after revising yet another paper, my roommate said to me, ”I don’t get why you don’t think you’re a good writer. You can be a little wordy sometimes, but you write with clarity and the ideas are all there. My edits are usually just reorganising sentences to improve the grammatical flow or make them consistent with one other. Actually, after reading your paper, I understand your idea better than I did when you were just telling me about it earlier today.” I thought about it for a little bit, and then it dawned on me how right she was. It was disheartening that my essays always came back with marks all over them, but they were mostly “break this sentence up here”, “reverse the order of the clauses in this sentence”, “cut these unnecessary words”. I started to see that not only was I better than I thought myself to be, but I actually made more sense while writing. Soon after, I realised that this clear articulation through writing doesn’t just go for academic essays, it also stands true for my thoughts and feelings. It’s always been that way, I just didn’t know it. 

Apart from looking back old artwork and characters every few months, I haven’t touched my DeviantART account in two years. It’s not even something I tell my friends about, both because it’s a little bit embarrassing and it simply doesn’t cross my mind. But recently, one of my friends found my profile and read some of my journal entries. He said that he wants nothing more than to give my past self a hug. I couldn’t recall exact posts, but I knew the gist: a lot of “asdjkhfljasd” and “ALL TEH FEELS” and using the Internet as my diary. Needless to say, I knew it was a cringefest. Despite this, my curiosity got the better of me and I logged on to see exactly what I’d been writing and posting to the general public in my early teenage years. As expected, I found erratically written posts about The Hobbit not winning an Oscar for makeup and hairstyling, character development in Young Justice and, worst of all, unabashed rants about my personal problems to the people of the Internet. 

“Pathetic.” 

That was the only thought that went through my mind as I read the first post with cold, unforgiving eyes. I looked down on and put a lot of blame on my past self for being so immature and attention whoring by posting extremely exaggerated personal things online. I’m not sure why I kept reading these personal posts, maybe I wanted to hate myself, but something unexpected happened. As I continued along, I felt myself softening more and more with each post. 

“Don’t let them see how much pain you feel every day.” 

And more. 

“Left behind.” 

And more. 

“I can’t stop feeling… empty.” 

And more. 

When I wrote these posts, I was feeling misunderstood by everyone around me. As I read on, I realised that I’d also been misunderstanding myself. I still think it was wrong of me to put my writings online, but I could feel the hurt in my words. They weren’t the words of someone making things up and trying to be poetic to garner sympathy and attention, they were the words of a girl who was confused and couldn’t communicate with spoken words. Maybe I did want a little bit of attention, but not in the sense of wanting others to feel sympathy for me, it was me, giving attention to myself, allowing myself the indulgence of self-empathy, of feeling. It wasn’t overreacting, it was coping. 

During my late teen years, I swung the other way. I thought my writing was enabling me to be dramatic and that I was only doing it for attention, so I stopped writing anything other than my essays for school altogether. I was so annoyed with myself for posting them online that I completely forgot the relief that writing brought me at all. Writing became associated with pointless essays on books that I didn’t care about, became something I thought I hated. It wasn’t until my roommate told me that I make better sense when writing that I was able to find my way back to writing and learned how to express myself properly again.

I should thank my friend for digging up my old DeviantART. I’ve known for a couple years now that my thoughts get tossed together like a salad sometimes when I speak and I articulate better through writing. But I only recently realised that it wasn’t a shift in disposition as I got older--I’ve always been this way, I just wasn’t aware of it all those years ago. Not a day goes by that I don’t write anything anymore, whether it be writing to express my feelings, writing stories for my characters, or just writing short pieces about something random on my mind and posting it to this blog. 

So am I good at writing? I’m not sure about that. But am I writer? Without a doubt.
