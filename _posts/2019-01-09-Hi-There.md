_Nice to meet you._


For a long time, all I’ve ever wanted was to be heard. For someone to hear me. But I’ve never been that great at putting my thoughts and feelings into spoken words, so here’s the space for me to do it the best way I know how: through my writing, through my art. It’s not intended for me to prove a point, write a great analytical essay with intellectual commentary or show anything off. It’s simply a space for me to share my thoughts, experiences and artwork.

To anyone that might have stumbled upon this blog, I hope you can find something helpful or interesting here.
