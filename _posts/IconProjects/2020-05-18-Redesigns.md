_A total redesign of all 16 Icons characters!_  


A while back, I realised that I wasn't entirely happy with the original designs for all the Icon characters, so I decided to redesign all of them! My thinking whilst designing these was not an alternative outfit, but to be a redesign. There had to be some thread of continuity between the previous design(s) and could not be a complete change. 

All of the Icon characters were originally created and designed between 2011 and 2012. Many of their visual designs had not changed prior to this redesign. Regardless, their 2020 redesigns are based off of their designs in the 2016 2.0 Edition.

The redesign was a lot of fun to do, especially since every character's personality has changed in some capacity since 2016.
