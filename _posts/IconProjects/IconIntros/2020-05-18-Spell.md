# Spell


Spell was created on February 29, 2012 and was originally a DC Comics fan character. Born into a family of superheroes, Spell has a strong sense of duty and has a multitude of powerful abilities such as hex magic, flight and super strength. Spunky, clever and protective, and she loves to bake!

Since Spell is the first one I typically design, her costumes tend to be a little more in line with the tropes of whatever theme I am doing and based off of the research I do for each project. Her costumes will tend to match surface level research for the theme and involve less experimentation. In a way, her costume is usually the one to really get me into the mindset of working on a new project. For example, in the Oktoberfest costume, Spell's design looks much more like the top row of images after googling "dirndl" than someone like Blaire's, for example. Common characteristics of dirndles are corset, aprot and white blouse underneath, which is exactly what Spell's costume has. Blaire's lacks the blouse. The same goes for hair, as well. Spell's hair is usually almost the exact same as a common hairstyle associated with a particular theme. 

The most prominent attribute that I take into consideration when designing Spell is superhero, and she loves it! So her costumes tend to be designed with attitude and confidence. She is by no means promiscuous, but she also does not hide. Another key part of her costume, that has stayed the same since the very beginning, is that she has a neck/chest plate piece. Except for the Dress Edition, all of Spell's designs have some form of chest covering, or at the very least, something wrapped around her neck. She is also always seen in skirts and her hair is often tied into a bun of some sort. The bun was not a feature of Spell originlly, but since I did her hair like that for so many Icon Projects, it was something I adopted into her redesign and made permanent. 

Spell is one of my most developed characters, and the one I've produced the most art of. Even though I didn't really start doing official Icon Projects until 2013, I'd loved doing costumes based off of themes for years, and I almost always used Spell as the model for them!
