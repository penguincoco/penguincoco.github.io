Spell was created on February 29, 2012 and was originally a DC Comics fan character. Born into a family of superheroes, she has a strong sense of duty and has a multitude of powerful abilities such as hex magic, flight and super strength. She is spunky, clever and protective, and an avid baker! She has a more slim body type, long legs and fair skin.

When doing any Icon project, Spell is typically the first one that I design. Due to this, her costumes tend to be a little more in line with the tropes of whatever theme I am doing and based off of the research I do for each project. Her costumes will tend to match surface level research for the theme and involve less experimentation. In a way, her costume is usually the one to really get me into the mindset of working on a new project. For example, in the Oktoberfest costume, Spell's design looks much more like the top row of images after googling "dirndl" than someone like Blaire's, for example. Common characteristics of dirndles are a corset, apron and white blouse underneath, which is exactly what Spell's costume has. Blaire's lacks the blouse. The same goes for hair, as well. Spell's hair is usually almost the exact same as a common hairstyle associated with a particular theme. 

The most prominent attribute that I take into consideration when designing Spell is that she is a superhero, and she loves it! So her costumes tend to be designed with attitude and confidence. She is by no means promiscuous, but she also does not hide. Many of Spell's designs have some form of chest covering, or at the very least, something wrapped around her neck. This is, in part, related to her status as a hero and how she tries to cover vulnerable parts of her body. In most cases, at least, it's not true for the Bombshells edition, which is a project in which it makes sense to cover up more if the Icons are going to dress up as WWII heroes. But I chose not to, in that case, because the style was also based off of pinups and Ant Lucia's DC Comics _Bombshells_ designed, in which the characters largely had exposed chests and shoulders. She is also always seen in skirts and her hair is often tied into a bun of some sort. The bun was not a feature of Spell originlly, but since I did her hair like that for so many Icon Projects, it was something I adopted into her redesign and made permanent.


#### Redesigning Spell 

![Spell Redesign Comparison](/assets/artwork/IconProjects/IconIntros/Spell/Redesign_Comparison_Spell.jpg)

Spell's redesign was rather challening at first, because I quite liked her overall design as it was. When I started the process, I led with giving her a space fighter vibe, despite not being from outer space. Of all the Icons, Spell is the most versed in technology so making her outfit more and more like something out of a sci-fi with each iteration was almost inevitable. Using "space fighter" as my guiding principle, I started off by trying to identify elements that I liked and would keep and ones that I dislike and did not make sense to me. 

Through all of her iterations, she has always had the neck and chestplate, so that was a guaranteed keep. Her gloves and the general shape of her costume around her chest (the blue strip connecting the two sides of her costume around her torso) and the exposed belly button, although maybe not the best for a warrior, were elements that I liked and wanted to keep.  

Components that I did not like included her partial shoulder pads. Not only did I realise they didn't quite make sense in terms of how they were attached to her costume, they do not serve as shoulder protection and are more decorative. I liked the decoration, but in her redesign I incoporated true shoulder protection whilst adding the decorative flaps on top still. I did not like her belt either--the spot connecting her belt at the waist didn't make sense to me, and made it unclear if her costume is a body suit with a skirt on top or one whole dress piece. The new design makes it much more clear that it's one piece. A huge change, as well, is that Spell has an ear piece in her new design. When I originally developed Spell, she was more of a powerhouse fighter to me. She has powers and she uses them, that's it. It was only through the years that I started integrating how she uses technology and her adeptness with it more and more. The ear piece can be activated to make a hologram lens, going over just her left eye, that allows her special analysis abilities with its interface.

In her new design, I also worked quite a bit to try and show height of her costume. Her previous designs looked more like cloth, and maybe the chest plate could be seen as maybe metal, or some other kind of hard material, but likely not. I tried to convey that her costume, at least at some parts, is made of some kind of carbon fiber, and is not necessarily soft to the touch. 

Again, since I already quite liked Spell's (2016) design, her new design was a bit of a challenge, but I'm quite happy with how it is now! It's more unique and conveys more of her personality!

_Spell is one of my most developed characters, and the one I've produced the most art of. Even though I didn't really start doing official Icon Projects until 2013, I'd loved doing costumes based off of themes for years, and I almost always used Spell as the model for them!
