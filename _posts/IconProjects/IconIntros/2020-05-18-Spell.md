#Spell


Spell was created on February 29, 2012 and was originally a DC Comics fan character. Born into a family of superheroes, Spell has a strong sense of duty and has a multitude of powerful abilities such as hex magic, flight and super strength. Spunky, clever and protective, and she loves to bake!
Since Spell is the first one I typically design, her costumes tend to be a little more in line with the tropes of whatever theme I am doing and based off of the research I do for each project. Her costumes will tend to match the "expected status quo" for something of that period and do less branching exploration.
