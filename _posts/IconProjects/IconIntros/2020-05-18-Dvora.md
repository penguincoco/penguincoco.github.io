# Dvora


[<< Return to Icons Index]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-18-Icons %})

Dvora was created on July 10, 2011, making her the second oldest Icon. She was originally created as a Lord of the Rings fan character. Born into royalty, she elected not to be a royal scholar but a captain of the guard. She is reserved, intelligent and tactful. 

When designing any costume for Dvora, her design is most prominently lead by her status as a warrior and a woodland elf. Unlike Khiri, who is another character whose design has a strong link to the natural world but is simultaneously a warrior, Dvora has no powers that make her different from other elves, so her costumes will not try and give off some impression of being a higher power, whether that be literal or metaphorical. Dvora's costumes will still radiate power and toughness, but stick to more natural colours and patterns still. Also, since Dvora comes from a medieval-esque, fantasy world, most of her costumes will contain natural colors like greens and browns. It will have fewer whites and blacks.
