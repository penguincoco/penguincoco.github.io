**_A world-class tactician whose dedication to logic and discipline makes her a Jack-of-all trades. Practical and responsible, Dvora gives her all to tackle the tasks at hand with patience and preciseness._**

Dvora was created on July 10, 2011, making her the second oldest Icon. She was originally created as a Lord of the Rings fan character. Born into royalty, she elected not to be a royal scholar but a captain of the guard. She is reserved, intelligent and tactful. She is the tallest of all of the Icons, has long arms and legs, a large chest and has a relatively fair complexion.

When designing any costume for Dvora, her design is most prominently lead by her status as a warrior and a woodland elf. Unlike Khiri, who is another character whose design has a strong link to the natural world but is simultaneously a warrior, Dvora has no powers that make her different from other elves, so her costumes will not try and give off some impression of being a higher power, whether that be literal or metaphorical. Dvora's costumes will still radiate power and toughness, but stick to more natural colours and patterns still. Also, since Dvora comes from a medieval-esque, fantasy world, most of her costumes will contain natural colours like greens and browns. It will have fewer whites and blacks when it can be helped.


#### Redesigning Dvora

In many ways, Dvora was one of the "easier" Icons to redesign. From the beginning, her costume had not changed much at all, and was quite simple but still had enough detail to it to be a starting place. Furthermore, since Dvora overarchingly lacked personality, comparatively to some of the other Icon characters, she was also one of the characters whose personality became much more developed as a consequence of the Icon Projects. 

As with many of the characters and their redesigns, I tried to start with defining traits and then pick out elements of Dvora's current costume that didn't make sense to me. Her original costume did not at all convey that she is a captain of the guard. It was too casual, lacked sensical armour and weaponry, and generally left her quite exposed. Her quiver was only supported with one (floppy looking) cord. I changed that to be a robust belt that also wraps around her waist (as most quivers do) to provide better support. 

Unlike many of the other Icon redesigns, her original place as a Lord of the Rings fan character came into play. Although, in the redesign, I tried to downplay each character's original universe, I still adopted certain aspects of elf design from the films to help guide her design. 

Truthfully speaking, Dvora's redesign is one of my favourites in terms of how it much evolved from her previous design into the current one. I think it was a big upgrade, both in terms of just overall aesthetic and doing service to who she is as a character and conveying certain traits.
