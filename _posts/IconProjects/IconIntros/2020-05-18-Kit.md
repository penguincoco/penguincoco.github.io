Kit was created on November 8, 2011, and was originally created as a Percy Jackson fan character. Daughter of the God of the Sun, Apollo, and Eva Artino, a Greek-Canadian musician. Kit is a brilliant musician and natural healer. 

Her design is another driven by her personality and interests. She loves music and is a care-free type, so her designs try to convey that. She wears bright, summery colours and typically loose-fitting clothing that allows her to move around a lot. 
Unlike many of the other Icons, Kit does not necessarily stick to just shorts or skirts. She plays with both, but she will definitely never be seen in full-length pants!
