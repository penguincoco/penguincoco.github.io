**_A true free spirit led by the desire to form social and emotional connections. Empathetic and observant, Kit’s curiosity and ability to understand people always makes even the most lost of people feel understood._**

Kit was created on November 8, 2011, and was originally created as a Percy Jackson fan character. Daughter of the God of the Sun, Apollo, and Eva Artino, a Greek-Canadian musician. Kit is a brilliant musician and natural healer. She has a medium toned complexion, long legs and is quite slim.

Her design is another driven by her personality and interests. She loves music and is a care-free type, so her designs try to convey that. She wears bright, summery colours and typically loose-fitting clothing that allows her to move around a lot. Simply put, she is the most Type B person that there could be. Out of all the Icons, she is the most laid back and easygoing, but do not mistake that for passiveness! She's easy to get along but also a spunky and fiesty! 

Unlike many of the other Icons, Kit does not necessarily stick to just shorts or skirts. She switches between both, but she will definitely never be seen in full-length pants!


#### Redesigning Kit

Kit was another character who was quite easy to redesign, in certain aspects, at least. Her design had not changed at all since her original one in 2013, and in it she simply wears the Camp Half-Blood T-Shirt, so in that regard, I wasn't particularly attached to the original design and it felt that there was the room for improvement. 

One of the most attention-drawing changes to Kit through each of the Icon projects is her skin tone. In the beginning, in part because I only had one skin tone pencil and wasn't really good at blending, all of the Icons used the same skin tone. For some of them, it was a close enough representation, but not in the slightest for Kit. Her mother is half Greek and half Canadian, so her skin tone shouldn't be quite as pale as some of the other Icons.

Something that Kit, as a character, really benefitted from in doing these Icon projects is that it became apparent to me that she would 100% be a overalls girl! Although overalls is just merely a piece of clothing, I think the clothes someone chooses (and chooses not to wear, for that matter, but we aren't concerned about that part of the argument for now) to wear can say a lot of their personality. Personally, when I imagine overalls, I think summer, loose, laid back and artistic, which perfectly captures Kit.
