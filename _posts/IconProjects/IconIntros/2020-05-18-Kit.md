## **_A true free spirit led by the desire to form social and emotional connections. Empathetic and observant, Kit's curiosity and ability to understand people always makes even the most lost of people feel understood._**

Kit was created on November 8, 2011, and was originally created as a Percy Jackson fan character. Daughter of the God of the Sun, Apollo, and Eva Artino, a Greek-Canadian musician. Kit is a brilliant musician and natural healer. 

Her design is another driven by her personality and interests. She loves music and is a care-free type, so her designs try to convey that. She wears bright, summery colours and typically loose-fitting clothing that allows her to move around a lot. 
Unlike many of the other Icons, Kit does not necessarily stick to just shorts or skirts. She switches between both, but she will definitely never be seen in full-length pants!


## **Redesigning Kit**

Kit was another character who was quite easy to redesign, in certain aspects, at least. Her design had not changed at all since her original one in 2013, and in it she simply wears the Camp Half-Blood T-Shirt, so in that regard, I wasn't particularly attached to the original design and it felt that there was the room for improvement. 

One of the most attention-drawing changes to Kit through each of the Icon projects is her skin tone. In the beginning, in part because I only had one skin tone pencil and wasn't really good at blending, all of the Icons used the same skin tone. For some of them, it was a close enough representation, but not in the slightest for Kit. Her mother is half Greek and half Canadian, so her skin tone shouldn't be quite as pale as some of the other Icons.

Something that Kit, as a character, really benefitted from in doing these Icon projects is that it became apparent to me that she would 100% be a overalls girl! Although overalls is just merely a piece of clothing, I think the clothes someone chooses (and chooses not to wear, for that matter, but we aren't concerned about that part of the argument for now) to wear can say a lot of their personality. Personally, when I imagine overalls, I think summer, loose, laid back and artistic, which perfectly captures Kit. Another thing that also started to grow on me, after the Kimono Edition, was both Kit's adoration for and her personality being compared to a sunflower. In a physical sense, sunflowers love to sunbathe and are heliotropic (meaning that they always face the sun, even as it moves across the sky). Maybe not dramatic to that extent, but Kit will spend every opportunity that she has outside under a bright sun. In a metaphorical sense, sunflowers represent optimism and happiness. Kit is a heavy optimist and wants nothing but for everyone to live a fulfilling life of love and joy. Sunflowers also naturally decontaminate soil! This may be a bit of a stretch, but as an empath, I like to think Kit can absorb the misfortune and unhappiness from those around her! 

Before the redesign, Kit was bland and she was one of my least favourite designed characters out of all the Icons, but I absolutely adore her redesign! Not only that, but it truly, I think, paints her as a fun-loving girl who just chases good times and the sun!
