Khiri was created on March 21, 2012, Khiri was originally a DC Comics fan character. Coming from a long line of guardians of the Earth and nature, Khiri inherited the power from her mother,  power that allows her to communicate with animals and manipulate elements of the natural world.

Khiri's design is led by the adjectives that define her: disciplined, clean and gentle. It's why, in the theme-based projects, her looks tend to align more with manager and head of operations. For example, in her Bombshell and Pokemon designs, she sports blazers with short dresses.

Khiri was a character I struggle a lot with on designing through the years. Her very first costume didn't last long at all. Her very first design was in March 2012 and by November 2012, it had been scraped. In the original Icons project in 2013, Khiri was already sporting her first redesign. Officially posted, Khiri has only ever had 3 non-theme-based costmes, but there have been at least 10 costumes I've actually designer for her throughout the years (it's a pity, in retrospect, that I never kept any of those sketches, but at the time I was designing I hated them so I just threw them all away).
