title: Khiri
---


Khiri was created on March 21, 2012, Khiri was originally a DC Comics fan character. Coming from a long line of guardians of the Earth and nature, Khiri inherited the power from her mother, power that allows her to communicate with animals and manipulate elements of the natural world. 

Khiri is quite unique in that the approach I take to her design differs based on what the project is. If it is one that is based more on a theme, like Bombshells or Pokemon, her design is led by her discipline. In these projects, her looks tend to align more with manager and head of operations. For example, in her Bombshell and Pokemon designs, she sports blazers with short dresses. However, in projects that are more based off of a type of clothing, like Dress and Oktoberfest, her design is led by her gentleness and calmness. In these projects, her oufits will give off more of a shy and reserved vibe. 

Khiri is a character that I've struggled a lot with on designing through the years. Her very first costume didn't last long at all. Her very first design was in March 2012 and by November 2012, it had been scrapped. In the original Icons project in 2013, Khiri was already sporting her first redesign. Officially posted, Khiri has only ever had 3 non-theme-based costmes, but there have been at least 10 costumes I've actually designer for her throughout the years (it's a pity, in retrospect, that I never kept any of those sketches, but at the time I was designing I hated them so I just threw them all away). Since Khiri's power is inherited, and her status is closer to a ethereal being, her design is challenging because it tries to balance the fine line between nature fairy and warrior. The design used in 2013 and 2016 clearly was much more on the warrior side. Looking back on it now, it definitely had to do with the sharp angles. I believe her latest design strikes a better balance, in that it still has armor, but no sharp angles and much of her armor almost looks decorative.
