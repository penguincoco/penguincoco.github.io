Khiri was created on March 21, 2012, Khiri was originally a DC Comics fan character. Coming from a long line of guardians of the Earth and nature, Khiri inherited the power from her mother,  power that allows her to communicate with animals and manipulate elements of the natural world.

Khiri's design is led by the adjectives that define her: disciplined, clean and gentle. It's why, in the theme-based projects, her looks tend to align more with manager and head of operations. For example, in her Bombshell and Pokemon designs, she sports blazers with short dresses.
