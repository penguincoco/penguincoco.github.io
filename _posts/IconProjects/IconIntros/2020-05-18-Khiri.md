### **_A soft-spoken woman who has an infallible sense of idealism and morality. Altruistic and passionate, Khiri fights not only to fix the immediate problem, but also to get to the heart of the matter and create lasting change._**

Khiri was created on March 21, 2012 and was originally a DC Comics fan character. Coming from a long line of guardians of the Earth and nature, Khiri inherited the power from her mother, power that allows her to communicate with animals and manipulate elements of the natural world. 

Khiri is quite unique in that the approach I take to her design differs based on what the project is. If it is one that is based more on a theme, like Bombshells or Pokemon, her design is led by her discipline. In these projects, her looks tend to align more with manager and head of operations. For example, in her Bombshell and Pokemon designs, she sports blazers with short dresses. However, in projects that are more based off of a type of clothing, like Dress and Oktoberfest, her design is led by her gentleness and calmness. In these projects, her oufits will give off more of a shy and reserved vibe. Overarchingly, though, she's always in a skirt or a dress and often with some sort of jacket on top. Although her hero costumes leave her shoulder exposed, as a person she often covers up. Also, in line with her actual costume design, she always has flowers in her hair and oftentimes scattered on her outfit. 


## **Redesigning Khiri**

Khiri is a character that I've struggled a lot with on designing through the years. Her very first costume didn't last long at all. Her very first design was in March 2012 and by November 2012, it had been scrapped. In the original Icons project in 2013, Khiri was already sporting her first redesign. Officially posted, Khiri has only ever had 3 non-theme-based costmes, but there have been at least 10 costumes I've actually designer for her throughout the years (it's a pity, in retrospect, that I never kept any of those sketches, but at the time I was designing I hated them so I just threw them all away). 

My general attitude towards her 2016 design was: "I like the concepts, but I dislike the executions". Since Khiri's power is inherited, and her status is closer to a ethereal being, her design is challenging because it tries to balance the fine line between nature fairy and warrior. The design used in 2013 and 2016 clearly was much more on the warrior side. Looking back on it now, it definitely had to do with the sharp angles. That was the first thing I did away with when redesigning Khiri. I still wanted to keep her golden chestplate, but I think an important thing I considered in the redesign is trying to make much of it look decorative. I figured that with keeping an entire gold chestplate, it was going to look like armour no matter what, so I could just focus on making it look less threatening and decorative. 

Another component that I liked, but disliked how I incorporated it, was the sash at her waist. Something that I generally do when designing a costume is not just think about how I might draw it, but if I were making the costume, how would I execute this? The way the sash is tucked into the chestplate is certainly doable, but in relation to my personal tastes, I don't think it makes much sense. For the redesign, I decided to make it a much more separate component that looks like it was tied around as an add-on rather than a built-in piece.

Of course with every iteration of Khiri's costume, I am more pleased with it than the previous, but I can confidently say I'm happier this time around right after finalising a new design than I have been compared to all other times. Hopefully it lasts! But even if it doesn't, I guess I can only keep moving forward!
