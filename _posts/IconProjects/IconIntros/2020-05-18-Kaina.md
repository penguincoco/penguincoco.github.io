## **_A fiercely independent woman of science and engineering. Dedicated and stubborn, Kaina will pursue concrete ideas and advancements until they work, one way or another._**

Kaina was created on April 3, 2012 and was originally created as a Legend of Korra fan character. The youngest daughter to an industrial engineer and company owner, Kaina is a highly adept inventor and engineer. This  compliments her ability to firebend quite well.

Her skill in engineering is the most prominent factor that I take into consideration when designing a new costume for her. For example, in the Bombshells edition, she is clearly an aerospace engineer. Her engineering capabilities are combined with her personality, strong and stubborn, and make it so each of her designs always give off a feeling of toughness. She is also always seen in pants unless the costume somehow implies skirts (such as dirndls). 


## **Redesigning Kaina**

Kaina went through a few very different design changes that weren't necessarily related to changes in her personality or character. In her initial 2012 design was done in April and merely based off of how Mako and Bolin were dressed in season 1 of Legend of Korra. Since they appeared more frequently than most other characters, it didn't occur to me to relate their clothing to their socio-economic class and assumed what they wore was common fashion for the entire show. The original design was also done whilst the first season was airing. It was about halfway through, after being exposed to more characters and designs, that I started to understand that I'd made a mistake in Kaina's clothing so I immediately ammended it. By May 2012, I switched Kaina's actual clothing piece to the one used in the 2016 version (which is also why it's the outfit that appears in the 2013 Original Icons project).

Sonething that developed about Kaina through the Icon projects is that her skill in engineering became a larger part of her identity. At the beginning, Kaina was more of a business woman who helped run the family company. Truthfully, I cannot remember when or why the shift towards being an actual engineer herself, but it's not a development I am unhappy about! Her redesign is much more appropriate for working with dangerous and dirty materials and much less fancy and aristocratic. She now sports a neckerchief (that can easily be pulled up whenever to cover her eyes and mouth from dust or other dangerous particles) and googles to protect her eyes.
