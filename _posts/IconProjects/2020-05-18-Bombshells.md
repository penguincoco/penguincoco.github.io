The Bombshells edition was inspired by the DC Comics figurine line Bombshells designed by Ant Lucia. I fell in love with the designs, and I liked the idea of the famous women of DC Comics being in World War II. It was also around the time that I was brainstorming what the next project following 2.0 should be. 

This, by far, was the hardest edition to design! The challenge with this project was that it was not based off of a piece of clothing, like a short dress or kimono, but dictated by a theme that I did not have any hand in. I spent quite some time studying 1940s pin ups, which is what the Bombshell designs are based off of, but that wasn't enough. I had to observe the Bombshells designs by Lucia and wanted mine to look as if they could fit in as a set with the rest. So, pin up, was the baseline, but there also needed to be some sort of superheroine-esque aspect to the costumes. 

Something different about this project, as well, was the design considerations behind their costumes. In this edition, I also considered what role they would have played in the war based on their actual profession and characteristics. For example, Kaina is an engineer, so she would've been an ally fighter pilot and engineer in the Bombshells context. To communicate that, I gave her goggles and gloves, as well as an aviator's jacket and tool belt. 

Spell would have been a liberator, a special forces freedom fighter. Khiri would have been the director of special forces. Dvora, a resistance leader in Europe. Kit, a medic disguised as a beach bum that would help soldiers coming back. Kaina, an RAF pilot. Meghan, a bartender supporting soldiers as much as possible. Minola, though on the field, would have tried acting more out of peace. Kohli, a uniform designer and manufacturer. Kati, a special forces ally fighter. Trinity, a Japanese schoolgirl that disapproved of Japan's alliance with Germany. Arietta, an allied sailor. Kaiya, a healer. An infiltrator disguised as a dancer in Spain. Zara, a special forces fighter, also acts as a magician to maintain ally morale. Blaire, a French aristocrat that funded resistance efforts in Europe and snuck people out of France. Miradi, a special forces cavalry and ammunition unit. 

I liked their designs so much that I did something I typically don't do with the Yearly Design Projects: redraw it. However, I did not redesign outfits or make major modifications to their original designs. It was more just an update on graphics, so to say. I've been debating redrawing other projects, like the Dress Edition, but I think that may end up involving changing the designs. I think what motivated me to redraw it was purely the fact that I liked the Bombshells concept and all 16 designs so much.
