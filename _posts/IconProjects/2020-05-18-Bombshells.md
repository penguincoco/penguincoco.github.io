#### **About This Theme**
The Bombshells edition was inspired by the DC Comics figurine line Bombshells designed by Ant Lucia. I fell in love with the designs, and I liked the idea of the famous women of DC Comics being in World War II. It was also around the time that I was brainstorming what the next project following 2.0 should be. 

This, by far, was the hardest edition to design! The challenge with this project was that it was not based off of a piece of clothing, like a short dress or kimono, but dictated by a theme that I did not have any hand in. I spent quite some time studying 1940s pin ups, which is what the Bombshells designs are based off of, but that wasn't enough. I had to observe the Bombshells designs by Lucia and wanted mine to look as if they could fit in as a set with the rest. Pinup  was the baseline, but there also needed to be some sort of superheroine-esque aspect to the costumes. My first sketches for this project actually extend back to 2016, maybe even 2015. The designs took some time. I remember that I did Spell, Khiri and Kit at first, and the designs they have in the final project were the first designs I made for them. But the rest, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't come up with satisfactory designs. I nearly abandoned the entire theme throughout the few "bursts" that I worked on the designs for this project. I kept coming back, though, because I really loved the Bombshells comic series and the designs never grew old. Most of the time, if I begin thinking about a theme but abandon it, it's because the allure of it wears off, but that certainly was not the case for this project.

I liked their designs so much that I did something I typically don't do with the Yearly Design Projects: redraw it. However, I did not redesign outfits or make major modifications to their original designs. It was more just an update on graphics, so to say. I've been debating redrawing other projects, like the Dress Edition, but I think that may end up involving changing the designs. I think what motivated me to redraw it was purely the fact that I liked the Bombshells concept and all 16 designs so much. To this day, the Bombshells series is probably still my favourite out of all the editions I've done so far, and I may even continue doing small projects with them.

#### **Each Character**
Something different about this project, as well, was the design considerations behind their costumes. Since this costume is more based off of a time period rather than a clothing theme, I also took what role they would have played in the war based on their actual profession and characteristics into consideration. For example, Kaina is an aerospace engineer, so she would've been an ally fighter pilot and engineer. To communicate that, I gave her goggles and gloves, as well as an aviator's jacket and tool belt. In line with how she is the purest form of a hero, Spell would have been a liberator, a special forces freedom fighter. Khiri would have been the director of special forces. Dvora, a resistance leader in Europe. Kit, a medic disguised as a beach bum that would help soldiers coming back. Meghan, a bartender supporting soldiers as much as possible. Minola, though on the field, would have tried acting more out of peace. Kohli, a uniform designer and manufacturer. Kati, a special forces ally fighter. Trinity, a Japanese schoolgirl that disapproved of Japan's alliance with Germany. Arietta, an allied sailor. Kaiya, a healer. Kari, an infiltrator disguised as a dancer in Spain. Zara, a special forces fighter infiltrating the Nazis. Blaire, a French aristocrat that funded resistance efforts in Europe and snuck people out of France. Miradi, a special forces cavalry and ammunition unit.
