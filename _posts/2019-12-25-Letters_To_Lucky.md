_A short story about friendship._


                                                                    February 3, 2017
    
    Hey Lucky,
    Surprise! Yeah! That’s right! I’m writing a letter! Remember when we were in elementary school and would write letters to each other? I remember how much we wanted to mail these letters and our parents wouldn’t let us. I guess that makes sense, we lived on the same street. But that didn’t stop us from drawing fake stamps on the envelopes and dropping them in each other’s cubbies in school. I actually found one of these letters recently and that inspired me to write this! Plus, we don’t live on the same street anymore, so I actually get to mail this! Muahaha!
    
    Anyway, how have you been lately!? How are things back home? School started again two weeks ago for me and it’s kind of hard getting back into the swing of things, but I’ll get used to it eventually. I hope lol. Classes have been going alright so far, nothing super hard, but then again, it’s only the second week. I’m not complaining though. I really like my games class so far! The homework is literally just to play games! Isn’t that crazy!? And everyone in the class is so nice, I really hope I can make some new friends! 

    Anyway, that’s all for now. Hope you don’t mind the letters too much, because I think I’m going to keep writing them instead. It’s cuter ;)
     
            Love,
                Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    You won’t believe what happened. I gave myself the worst haircut ever. I don’t mean this as, “oh, yeah, it just came out kind of lopsided” or, “it didn’t come out the way I wanted”,  I mean this as the worst haircut ever. I was trying to fix my bangs and I gave myself BABY BANGS. They’re so short right now and I look so stupid! It’s hilarious and embarrassing at the same time. I’ve been pinning it back, but now whenever I go outside my forehead feels naked. Does that sound stupid? I feel like it does lol I’m not sure what’s stupider, my haircut or thinking my forehead is NAKED. But HONESTLY, it’s SO embarrassing! What should I do!? I know people probably don’t care, but I legitimately don’t want to talk to anyone because I feel like they think my hair looks so dumb!
    
    Ugh.

    Tell me I’m being crazy, please :’(

    Anyway, enough about my disastrous haircut, how are things on your end? How’s your dog? Send pictures along with the next letter, please! 
     
            Love,
                Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    It’s been raining here a lot lately. Ugh, I just wish the sun would come out. Rain in the city is disgusting. There are so many puddles, but not the pretty kind you can see your reflection and play in (not the kind of rain you’d like). They’re the kind that are shiny in a weird green way because of the oil they’ve washed up! Disgusting. Still, a little rain is nice to wash away all of the spring pollen. And you’re right, the smell of rain hitting concrete is still one of the best things in the world.
    
    Anyway, an update on my haircut--my bangs have grown back a little, thank goodness for that hahahaha. Classes are still going smoothly. Not much else to report, I suppose. Life’s been uneventful, and honestly, I’m okay with that. No news is better than bad news, right?
     
            Love,
                Samina

    Hey Lucky, 
    A bit of a change in setting today. I write to you not from my room but from the glorious...hospital! 
    
    Ugh.
    
    It started as a weird squeezing sensation in my chest. I thought it was just some bad muscle aches and it went away after a few minutes so I ignored it at first. It happened maybe once or twice more that day but I didn’t think too much about it. It happened again last night but it didn’t go away and it got really hard to breathe so my roommate brought me to the hospital. They hooked me up to an oxygen machine and took a few tests that I’m currently waiting on the results for. I hope it isn’t anything bad... I don’t want to miss class tomorrow!
    
    Don’t laugh.
    
    Yeah yeah, I’m a nerd, I know I know.
    But hey! It’s that games class I told you about! And we’ll be playing Super Smash Melee! I’m usually really bad at the games we play, but I’m going to destroy everyone >:)
    
    Anyway, that’s all for now. I’ll write to you again once I know the results of the test, and more importantly, about how I win at Smash. 
     
            As always, love,
                Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    So... I didn’t get to go to class... Didn’t get to play Smash :/ I’m actually still in the hospital...
    
    The doctors said that there’s something wrong with me. Something neurological? I’m not entirely sure, to be honest, and I don’t know if I like it more or less that way. They want to keep me in the hospital for a little longer and they even said they might put me on medication... It all sucks so much. I hate it.

    Hey Lucky,
    Sorry, it’s been a while since my last letter. I’m actually back at home right now. So, after my last letter, I was released from the hospital with medication in tow. I took it for a few days, but I started to feel better again, so I stopped. Then, a few days after that, my chest started to hurt again in class. I told my roommate, and she said I should take the medication if I was in pain, but I hate those damn pills, so I didn’t. The next morning, I was in class when the chest pain started again and I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t want to cause a scene, though, so I didn’t say anything... then it got so bad that I legitimately started to cry.
    
    It was so embarrassing.
    
    I was taken back to the hospital and the doctors told me that I have to keep taking the pills if I want to get better... I started wearing a mask too. Keep all those city germs away. They also said school might not be the best place for me to be right now, you know, natural sources of stress and all that, so I came home 6 days ago... So... That’s my life lately...
    
    It sucks. 
     
            ~Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    I’ve been spending most of my time watching movies lately. Makes me think about how we used to take advantage of the 20% off tickets and go to the cinema together on Monday evenings. After the movie we’d get ice cream from Mr. and Mrs. Oleksiy’s ice cream parlour and eat sitting on the abandoned train tracks behind the shop. We’d talk about the movie, school, our classmates, your dream to become a vet, my dream to become a designer, we could talk about anything. Guess Garfield would’ve hated me because Mondays were my favourite days. 
    
    My mom told me a few days ago that the little ice cream shop closed. She said that all of the land in that area was bought and is being turned into yet another bank. She told me which bank it was, but I don’t really give a damn.
    
    7 minutes. That’s how long it took us to walk from the theater to the ice cream parlour. We always walked, even after we both got our licenses, we always walked. “How was the movie, girls?” Mrs. Oleksiy always asked us without fail. And I swear she always gave us a little more than the other customers. Now instead of ice cream and Mrs. Oleksiy it’ll be financial debt and bank tellers in suits. 
    
    The world just isn’t a fair place.

    Hey Lucky,
    I saw my doctor today. I nearly blew a fuse when she asked me why I’m wearing a mask. “It’s not contagious.” THE MASK IS TO PROTECT ME FROM GETTING MORE SICK.
    
    Idiot.
    
    THEN. She asked me how I’ve been feeling lately now that I’ve been home for a month and I actually exploded at her. How the hell does she think I’m feeling? I’m filled to the brim with pills, I can barely leave my house, I’m home instead of at school with me friends, HOW DOES SHE THINK I FEEL? That’s all anyone ever asks nowadays and my answer is always the same. As great I can be, obviously! OBVIOUSLY! No one understands how I feel and they always say everything will be better, because it’s as easy as that! 
    
    OBVIOUSLY. 
     
            ~Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    I hate being sick so much. I hate this, I hate everything. I hate that the sun keeps rising and setting, rising and setting, as if everything is normal, but it’s NOT. 
    It’s summer vacation. I should be out having fun, but every time I go out, I just feel tired. It’s those damn pills. 
    I just want to get better... You know that I’ve never believed in a god or anything, but I’ve found myself praying a lot lately. To who? To what? I have no idea. But I just want to get better. I would give up anything to be able to go outside again. Not have to take pills 3 times a day. I’ll never lose my temper again. I’ll give up buying anything. I’d do anything. I’m sick of being SICK. 
    
    If there’s anything or anyone out there listening, please, PLEASE. I’m begging them. 
     
            Love,
                Samina

    Hey Lucky,
    Sorry it’s been such a long time, I just haven’t really had much to say lately, I guess. I’m just at home still. I should be back in school, but, well, just at home doing nothing.  
    
    It’s snowing right now. Hell, it’s so pretty. Last time I wrote you I was mad that I couldn’t go out. I guess I don’t really have that problem anymore--I’m kind of glad that it’s winter. Makes me at least feel like there’s something other than being sick stopping me from going outside. 
    
    I like watching the snow. I could just watch it for hours. It’s kind of funny, isn’t it? When we’re young we get so excited when it snows and are probably out playing in it before we can even properly put our boots on. Remember that time when we were like, 9? We went sledding on the hill behind your house. We tried all combinations of going down together--we crammed our bodies into one sled, held hands as we sat in our individual sleds so we’d go down together. And then we had the most outrageous idea. I got onto my sled on my stomach and then you stacked your’s on my back and got on top of it. It was so much fun in that moment but in retrospect, I have no idea what we were thinking. We could have broken our necks. I guess that’s just a part of getting older? We realise what’s a bad idea and we start to enjoy watching the snow more than playing in it. Sorry if that doesn’t make sense, it’s late and I’m a little sleepy right now. Maybe it’s the snow? 
     
            Love always,
                Samina

“Hey Lucky,” 

Samina let out a deep exhale. She must have put her mask on lopsided because it fogged up her glasses. She adjusted the fabric’s position on her nose, cleaned her glasses off with her sleeve and put them back on. But she messed up again, and her glasses fogged up again. She fixed the mask again. Her glasses fogged up again. 

Fix.

Fog.

Fix.

Fog.

She wasn’t sure when she started crying, but a few teardrops had fallen onto the paper distorting her usual “hey, lucky” to something like “hoy looky”. Holding up the damp paper close to her face, Samina could feel the tears brimming the edges of her eyes. She held her breath for a moment and the world seemed to hold it with her. And then suddenly, the tears came spilling over her cheeks.

You’d think she was a pitcher for the MLB by the way she hurled what had formerly been the beginning of another letter crumpled up into a little ball at the wall. Clutching the hair on the sides of her head at the roots so hard, she could feel them protesting for her to stop and the nails digging into her scalp. She tasted the salt from the tears that snuck their way into her mouth. She could feel her breath staggering. Her therapist always said that whenever she started to feel her breath get uneven, just imagine she’s reading sheet music and each inhale and exhale is a whole note.

_In 2, 3, 4. Out 2, 3, 4. In 2, 3, 4. Out 2, 3, 4._

She never had the heart to tell her therapist that she can’t read sheet music. 

_“Therapist?”_
_“Doctor?”_
_“Same thing.”_
_“Shit.”_

**************************************************************************************

_“What am I doing here?”_

Samina wasn’t even sure she was ready to be there again yet. She bit down hard on her lip and could feel the mud compress under each foot as she shifted her weight between the left and right. The snow had melted already leaving the ground like one paper towel that had the task of cleaning up a flood. Saturated. Squishy. Much like the box in her hands as it started to dampen from the moisture on her palms.

“Hey, Lucky.” Samina’s voice cracked as she spoke the name she hadn’t dared say outloud in nearly a year. She’d written it dozens of times, but hadn’t once said it since the funeral.

Clutching the box close to her chest, she peered down at the smooth stone in front of her.

                                    In Loving Memory of
                                        Lucky Hibi
                                The girl with the biggest heart
                                 November, 1997 ~ January, 2017

“I, uh, I’m sorry that I didn’t come see you sooner... I... I got sick for a while and it was bad. I had to see the doctor, was kept in the hospital for a while, prescribed medication. All of it... I...”

She paused and swallowed the lump in her throat.

“I miss you.”

Her voice was squeaky, like a mouse, but somehow quieter.

“I... I couldn’t accept that you were gone... I was so angry for so long. So full of hate. I hated that the earth kept rotating. I hated that the sun kept shining.”

“But then I remembered... You loved the rain, didn’t you?”

She felt the tears start rolling down her cheeks again, but differently this time. Not like a torrential rain that floods peoples homes, but more like a hidden little stream somewhere in the mountains.

“I wrote you, you know. A lot, actually. I miss getting to tell you everything." Taking the first envelope out of the box, she tore through the glue she’d sealed nearly a year ago and unfolded the paper inside. “I hope you don’t mind too much if I tell you now.”

“Hey, Lucky,” she said in a shaky, but confident, voice.

Once again, a fat drop of water fell onto the paper, rudely interrupting her and smudging the ink. Samina touched her cheek self-consciously, unaware that she’d started crying again. But her hand came away dry.

It wasn’t tears that had started falling, but a soft, quiet rain.
