**Introduction**

For as long as I can remember, I've always loved creating characters. I love giving them nnames, personalities, trying as much as possible to turn them into real people. In 2011, I created a DeviantART account and began posting my characters, but looking back on it now, I think this love for character creation started long before then. I was definitely a kid with lots of imaginary friends, and I've found old drawings dating to before 2011 of characters I'd dreamed up. But, for the sake of putting a date on it, I say my journey as a character creator began in 2011.

By 2013, I'd already created dozens of characters, and it was beginning to get difficult to keep track of them all. It was around that time that I noticed I had certain characters that carried more significance than others, for whatever reason. Some were just older characters, some were ones that I latched onto and dove deeply into character development. So in 2013, as part of a mini project, I decided to pick 16 of my "top" characters and draw them in a compilation project--which I called "Icons"--to represent their importance to me. And what made a character important to me? How did I choose the 16? Well, in the words of my 2013 self: "They all protect me. They keep me company when I'm lonely. Banish my fears when I'm scared... Comfort me when I'm heartbroken or upset. Reassure me when I lose hope. Talk to me when I'm lost and confused. These are the things special [original characters] should always do."

Why I chose 16, I'm still unclear on that myself, but I suspect it had something to do with having an even 4x4 matrix to draw the characters! Whatever the reason, these 16 girls mean the world to me. I don't think I knew it back then, but these 16 original Icons would grow beyond just a one-time project of displaying 16 of my most significant characters together, but would evolve to yearly projects of drawing them in various costumes.
